        <h3>Work Ethic</h3>
        <p>Problem Solver: I love a challenge and if I don't know something, you can bet I'm going to learn it.</p>
        <p>Accountable: I take full ownership of my work and see it through to completion.</p>
        <p>Detail-Oriented: I always do my best to make sure my wording is on point and there are no mistakes in my work.</p>
        <p>Documenter: Thanks to my love of writing, if a process is not documented...it will be! It's important to have vital processes
            documented for continuity of business.</p>
