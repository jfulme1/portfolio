        <h2>Words Matter</h2>
        <p>I've always loved writing. Maybe it's because I've always been a rule follower or because I'm a perfectionist. 
        Regardless, I believe words matter. The words we choose to communicate, whether written or electronic, are so important. They not
        only set the tone for a conversation, they also help or hinder the understanding of your audience. Over the past 20 years, I've 
        primarily worked in Learning &amp; Development. From creating synchronous and asynchronous training content to procedures, emails, newsletters, 
        FAQs, video scripts, and websites, I&apos;ve had amazing opportunities to create it all. Interested in learning more?</p>
