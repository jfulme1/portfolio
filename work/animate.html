    <h3>Animated Character</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to create a character performing a simple action using skills I learned in the Adobe Animate 
            course.The simple animation I wanted my character to perform is a hand wave.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Banner</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to create an interactive banner using skills I learned in the Adobe Animate course. I saw 
                a vehicle advertisement banner that I wanted to try and recreate. There are glowing hot spots around a vehicle image with 
                text that appears when the user clicks the hot spots.</p>

    <h3>Animated Infographic</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to create an animated infographic using skills I learned in the Adobe Animate course. 
                    The infographic I created is for a ficticious mobile app and includes animated mock ups.</p>
