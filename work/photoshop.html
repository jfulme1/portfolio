    <h3>Photo Restoration</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to restore a photo using skills I learned in the Adobe Photoshop course. For this project, 
            I took a damaged photo and used the tools I learned to restore it.</p>

    <h3>Magazine Cover</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to create a magazine cover using skills I learned in the Adobe Photoshop course. 
                I recently saw Matt Damon on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire playing for one of his charitable foundations. I choose 
                to create a magazine cover featuring him and calling attention to the humanitarian work he's doing.</p>

    <h3>Social Ads</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to create a social media ad series using skills I learned in the Adobe Photoshop course. 
                My partner is a realtor and allowed me to make a few social media advertisements for his business. </p>
